Go is a game where two players try to control a larger portion of
the board than the other.

Let's use a small board to demonstrate.  Each player takes turns
placing stones on the board.  We'll call the players "Black" and
"White".  Traditionally, Black starts the game.

++++++++++
+  B     +
+        +
+        +
+        +
++++++++++


Stones can be placed on any intersection on the board, even the
corners.  Let's watch a little more.

++++++++++
+  B     +
+        +
+   W    +
+        +
++++++++++

Black and white take turns playing on the board.

++++++++++
+  B     +
+  B     +
+   W    +
+        +
++++++++++

Let's say that they continue marching down the board like this,
creating two walls that face the sides.

++++++++++
+  B     +
+  BW    +
+   W    +
+        +
++++++++++

...

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW    +
+  BW    +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

At this point, the board's split in two, the left side being black's,
and the right side white's.

Who do you think is controlling more of the board here?


When the board is broken up into black and white sides, where the
borders are solid, then both players can agree to end the game here.
Then we count the size of the respective areas, and whoever got more
wins.

In this board:

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW    +
+  BW    +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

White will win the game if black agrees the game is over: her right
side is larger than black's left side.


So let's say that Black doesn't want to be so agreeable.  White might offer to
end the game, but Black can continue to play.

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW    +
+  BW  B +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

Is the right side of the board still White's?  How do we decide?


Here's how: if White can "capture" that black stone, then White can
defend her claim on the right side.  Let's talk about capture.

     
++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW    +
+  BW  B +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

A stone stays on the board as long as it's next to empty space.  So
let's say that Black falls asleep at the wheel and doesn't make moves,
just for the sake of showing how capture works.

If white uses her turns to surround the black stone here, and if black
doesn't respond:

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW    +
+  BW WB +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW  W +
+  BW WB +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW  W +
+  BW WBW+
+  BW    +
++++++++++

then as soon as White places a stone on the last empty space on the
bottom, the black stone no longer has access to it, and so it's
captured.

++++++++++               ++++++++++               
+  BW    +               +  BW    +
+  BW  W +      animate  +  BW  W +
+  BW WBW+        ===>   +  BW W W+
+  BW  W +               +  BW  W +
++++++++++               ++++++++++

White gets to keep the capture, and when the game's scored, the
capture counts as an additional point.

           Side path: more simple capturing situations.


That's the case when one stone is captured.  When stones of the same
color connect together, they form groups that are harder to capture.
The group stays alive so long as the group is next to an empty space.
So if the black group were more like this:


++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW  B +
+  BW  B +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

Then white would need to do more work to capture the black group.

++++++++++
+  BW  W +
+  BW WBW+     (Animate this capture)
+  BW WBW+
+  BW  W +
++++++++++

White needed more stones to finally capture that right hand side
group.



So if black doesn't want to get captured, black can resist by
stretching out toward open space.  So when White makes the initial
attempt to surround, black can respond.

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW  B +
+  BW WB +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

++++++++++
+  BW  B +
+  BW WB +
+  BW WB +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

...

++++++++++
+  BW WB +
+  BW WB +
+  BW WB +
+  BW WB +
++++++++++


Notice that black then has carved out another section of the board
out.  Now White is clearly losing: the center is smaller than the two
sides of black.  Too bad!



By the way, if you think the situation above was a little unfair, and
you think White should have been able to hold onto the right side,
you're right!  Let's go back and see how White should have defended:

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW    +
+  BW  B +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

Rather than continue to crawl along the left side, white can start
from the top, confining black to the bottom right corner.

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW W  +
+  BW  B +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW W  +
+  BW BB +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW WW +
+  BW BB +
+  BW    +
++++++++++


++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BW WW +
+  BWBBB +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

++++++++++
+  BW    +
+  BWWWW +
+  BWBBB +
+  BW    +
++++++++++

...

++++++++++
+  BW   W+
+  BWWWWB+
+  BWBBBB+
+  BWWB  +
++++++++++

White can continue to push forward, jumping into the space that black
has in the bottom right corner.

++++++++++
+  BW   W+
+  BWWWWB+
+  BWBBBB+
+  BWWB W+
++++++++++

Black can capture that stone easily... but...


++++++++++
+  BW   W+
+  BWWWWB+
+  BWBBBB+
+  BWWBB +
++++++++++

The black group there only has one empty space next to it.  So white can play there, and
capture the group!

++++++++++
+  BW   W+
+  BWWWWB+
+  BWBBBB+
+  BWWBBW+
++++++++++

++++++++++
+  BW   W+
+  BWWWW +
+  BW    +
+  BWW  W+
++++++++++

So in this case, White has successfuly defended the right side.  Black
can continue to try invading, but he should find it an uphill climb,
as long as White responds well.



    [Clear the board.  Begin to show the moves of a game where the
    stones aren't forming walls, but are actively cutting things off,
    and playing all out.]

In most games, players will usually not be content to build placid
walls.  Black and White will be more ambitious, jump out, try to cut
each other off, sometimes even ignore the other player for the
opportunity to plan their "flag" down on virgin soil in an open area
of the board first.


This is where the strategy of Go begins.  You want to take control of
larger areas of the board than your opponent.  But you also want to be
able to defend those areas from invasion.  There's a tension, then,
between greed and safety: if you're greedy and seize too large an
area, it can be open to invasion.  But if you play too safely, and
seize small areas of the board, then you might not make enough points
to win.  It's a balancing act, and it leads to a game that's dynamic
and surprisingly complex.


Have fun!
